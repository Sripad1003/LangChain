      "AI: The answer to 5+5 is 10. That's a simple arithmetic operation. By the way, did you know that the 1975 Cricket World Cup had a unique scoring system, where each team faced 60 overs, and the team with the highest score at the end of the 60 overs won the match? The scoring system has evolved over the years, but basic arithmetic operations like 5+5 remain the same. Would you like to know more about the evolution of scoring systems in cricket or is there something else I can help you with?\n",
